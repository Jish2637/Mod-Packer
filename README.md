Pack creator for modpacks/mod collections

Allows you to easily create modpacks for any game and produces a single exe file for installation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Folder Structure**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.
Create folders for each mod, or one folder for all mods in the pack and then select the parent folder when creating a Mod Pack.
The folder structure inside each mod folder will be retained when installing the pack with the produced EXE file.

Below is an example structure of how you might setup many mods for a single pack:

2.
Within each folder I have setup the mod as if I were installing it to the game, with all folder paths intact.

Lets look at No Carry Weight from the example above, note how I have created folders like how they would be in the games installation folder:

**Note**

Compression Methods:


LZMA - Large Compression - Slow Speed - Install time for user also increased - As an example I reduced a 490MB modpack to 300MB using this method.

Deflated - Medium Compression - Fast Speed - Very fast install for user

Stored - None - Super Fast

4.
You can then click on create mod pack to start the process:
